This week, WeTheSWEople, my SWE IDB team, completed [our IDB1 project](http://swethepeople.me/). This was the first large-scale project I'd worked on with a large team and submitting our completed website was very gratifying. As I noted in our report, most of the members of my team had very little prior experience using the required tools – Github project boards, React, Slack – and going from beginners to having intermediate-level knowledge was exciting. We're looking forward to IDB2!

## What did you do this past week?
This week we finished IDB1! We had two of our three models completed coming into this week and we spent Monday through Thursday working on our legislative districts model and finalizing our report. In addition, we cleaned up our Github issue tracker and created a second project board for stories. We linked each issue to a story and created guidelines for commits, issues, and pull requests.

## What's in your way?
The biggest thing standing in our way is that the guidelines and rubric for IDB2 have not yet been released. In addition, I want to do some serious code cleanup on our IDB1 repository. The biggest downside to splitting into pairs to complete tasks was that sometimes sub-teams implemented similar functionality differently. Before we begin phase two, we need to streamline the codebase and create consistent stylistic standards. Otherwise, our code is going to quickly become indecipherable.

Within the project, besides needing to add a good linter, we want to create an auto-deployment pipeline from our master branch. Though we will have to turn it off while the project is being graded, it will be helpful during development.

## What will you do next week?
Next week we will prepare our repository and "best practices" standards for IDB2 and begin working preemptively on dynamically pulling and storing data from our external source data APIs. In addition, I will begin preparing for our first exam. I plan to create a Github repository to aggregate my notes and to review the reading material and quizzes.

## What's my experience of the class?
I'm still enjoying the class. I enjoyed the first IDB project much more than I expected to, and I've gotten better at asking questions during lecture.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Over the past few months, I've started to embrace the "Inbox Zero" philosophy. In "Inbox Zero," one's inbox is always empty. The only emails that belong in the inbox, the thought goes, are ones that will be dealt with immediately. Anything else should be filed away. Having a clear inbox, I've discovered, removes a huge weight off of my shoulders. It's stressful to have a constant reminder of work I need to accomplish or people I need to reply to. All starting "Inbox Zero" requires is an hour or two to completely clear your inbox. Delete emails you don't need to keep around and file or archive emails you want to save. One tool I've found to be extraordinarily helpful is [Polymail](https://polymail.io/). Polymail allows you to designate emails as "Read Later" and have them appear in your inbox at a specific future time. For example, I typically have airplane and bus tickets reappear in my inbox the night before. I now solely use Polymail as my email client on my phone and computer.
