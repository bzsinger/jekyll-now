title: Hello SWE
---

Last week, January 15-21, was my first week in CS 373: Software Engineering. This post is the first in a series of weekly blog entries in which I will document my experience of the class. One of the articles we were assigned to read for this week was Joel Sposky's [Advice for Computer Science College Students](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students). In the article, Sposky notes that "there’s a lot of wonderful, useful code buried on sourceforge somewhere that nobody uses because it was created by programmers who don’t write very well (or don’t write at all), and so nobody knows what they’ve done and their brilliant code languishes." I wouldn't necessarily call my code "brilliant," but he makes a good point. To remedy the dearth of intensive writing courses for Computer Science majors, he highly recommends that students improve their writing skills by "start[ing] a journal or weblog." So that's what I'll be doing for the next semester. (Oh, and also, this is a required assignment.)

## What are your expectations of the class?
I've only heard good things about Professor Downing's courses: [Software Engineering](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373) and [Object-Oriented Programming](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs371p/). I try to do my homework before taking classes and I noticed that Professor Downing consistently receives high [Course Instructor Survey ratings](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/Evaluations.html). I'm nervous about this class's workload (and daily quizzes), but I'm excited about building a large project with a sizable team over the semester. I'm looking forward to learning about new tools and expanding my software engineering repertoire. I expect to leave this class feeling fulfilled and excited about how I can apply what I've learned to internships, personal projects, and other classes.

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was syllabus week. On Wednesday, our first day of class, we reviewed items on the syllabus and discussed the format of the class. On Friday we were quizzed over the content of the syllabus and began discussing Docker and Python. I spent the weekend reading three articles about computer science and college and eight chapters of Extreme Programming Installed, and I forked [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) where I wrote my first blog post.

## What's in your way?
I have not yet fully decided which courses I am going to take this semester – I have to choose between two ethics classes and also figure out whether I will be in Computer Security this spring. Because my schedule is still somewhat fluid, I have not yet been able to settle into a semester routine. I am looking forward to doing that over the next two weeks.

## What will you do next week?
Judging from [previous semesters](https://web.archive.org/web/20170610094330/http://www.cs.utexas.edu:80/users/downing/cs373/Schedule.html), I expect that we will further discuss the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) and unit testing in preparation for our first project. Outside of class, I plan on working more on this site and starting next week's readings early. I am also going to be the lead TA of a free iOS workshop offered to [UT students](https://apply.codepath.com/organizations/codepathorg/cohorts/119/locations/517/) by [CodePath](http://codepath.org/) and I am excited to get started!

## What's my experience of the class?
There's not much to judge yet and I know I will revisit this question in future weeks with a more satisfying answer. I've enjoy the lectures, but because we aren't able to annotate Professor Downing's notes, I sometimes struggle to keep up with the class. I've found myself frantically scribbling down answers to questions while he continues with the lecture. I am looking forward to getting into a rhythm and not falling 10-15 seconds behind the class.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I'm saving my initial idea for tip-of-the-week for next week because I have a time-sensitive pick! I've come to realize that learning and building projects outside of the classroom is one of the most valuable things a computer science student can do in college. Recruiters get tired of seeing the same class projects on every student's resume, and having a project of your own is a sure-fire way to stand out.

Last spring, I participated in CodePath's UT iOS workshop and began my foray into mobile development. I can't count the number of times I've discussed our final team project, [a SureWalk app](https://github.com/codepath-surewalk/SureWalk), with recruiters and interviewers this fall. Beyond the career benefits, I've really enjoyed learning a new skill by working on hands-on projects, and I'm excited to lead the class this semester. Apply [here](https://apply.codepath.com/organizations/codepathorg/cohorts/119/locations/517/) to participate in the workshop this semester and feel free to reach out to me over Facebook, email, or in person with any questions!
