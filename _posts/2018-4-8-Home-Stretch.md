This week, my plate, to put it lightly, was full. On top of IDB work for SWE, a side job began to pick up, I had an essay due, and to top it off, it was Passover.

## What did you do this past week?
This past week, my group and I completed and submitted our IDB3 project. My initial task for the project was improving our site's data collection and use, but when it became clear that we would not have the time to integrate the new data into our final product, I shifted to working on knocking out smaller issues for searching, sorting, pagination, filtering, the model grid pages, and the model detail pages. Toward the end of the week, I again took on the role of spearheading and editing our project report. SWE was my primary focus throughout the week, but my other obligations created a perfect storm that made the week tumultuous and stressful.

## What's in your way?
Though we did a good job planning for IDB3, we still ended the week sprinting toward the finish line. Before we can get serious work done on IDB4, we will need to restructure and clean up our repo from IDB3. In addition, as I learned last week, non-SWE classes and obligations have the nasty habit of interfering as soon as SWE work begins to heat up. My goal for next week is to knock out my non-SWE obligations early so that I can tackle SWE work.

## What will you do next week?
My first goal for the week will be to restructure the repo and recuperate from IDB3. In addition, I'd like to get serious work done on IDB4 beyond planning and mapping out stories and tasks.

## What's my experience of the class?
I'm still enjoying the class. Now that my daily quizzes can only replace old ones, my anxiety about them has (irrationally) dropped. We just wrapped up our unit on SQL and I'm excited to learn about refactoring!

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is to be the second penguin. The first person to stand up or take initiative gets all the credit, but the second person is just as important. Without someone joining in, the first person can be dismissed as crazy or a curiosity. The second person makes the first more acceptable, the third helps the second, the fourth helps the third, and so on. But without a second penguin, the first has no impact.

The next time a friend goes out on a limb, join them! The worst that can happen is that you fall. If you fall, you fall together â€“ and you'll have a great story to tell.
