title: Finishing Up
---

This week, my team began work on IDB4, the final part of the IDB saga. Though we worked hard this week, this was probably the most fun I've had doing IDB so far.

## What did you do this past week?
This week my team and I created user stories as customers for the [HikingAdventures](http://HikingAdventures.me) group. In addition, I finished up work on my drastically-improved Census scraper, which aggregates more than 50 data points about each Congressional district, and added a news (Articles) scraper that pulls from an API that collects news stories from around the web. Now, each representative details page includes a set of recent news stories in addition to a trio of sponsored bills.

This week was a lot of fun. Though the work was just as hard (if not harder) than before, this week we had a lot more control over our project's direction. We've been working on several small projects throughout IDB that haven't fit official requirements, and we reached out to our customers (before they provided us with stories) and told them about the direction we wanted to take our project. Though they didn't add all of the pieces we wanted to the requirements, being able to have that back-and-forth conversation with them was very valuable. We also made sure to reach out to the members of the project we're customers for to discuss the direction they saw their project going.

## What's in your way?
Time. IDB4 is due this Thursday and we have a lot we want to accomplish before then. I have to fix a lot of the backend tests I broke when I added fields to models in our database and we have a lot of work to do integrating our new data on the frontend. I'm excited, though.

## What will you do next week?
Next week we'll finish IDB4 and prepare for presentations. We have some final edits to make to our technical report and we'll need to integrate our graders' IDB3 feedback.

## What's my experience of the class?
I've enjoyed the class thus far. I still have not formed a formal concrete opinion on the course as a whole, but it's been a pleasant experience.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is to explore Austin. We're usually confined to campus and the area immediately surrounding it, but I've come to discover how much there is to do in the city. UT creates an enclave and tricks us into thinking that school-related activities are the only worthwhile thing to do. Break of out the UT bubble! Walk around downtown, visit Zilker, go to The Domain, go hiking â€“ enjoy the city!
