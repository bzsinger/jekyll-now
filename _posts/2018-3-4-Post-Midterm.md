title: Post-Midterm
---

Last week, I focused almost exclusively on studying for the SWE midterm. This week, I plan on continuing work on our IDB2 project and preparing for independent work during spring break.

## What did you do this past week?
Because our first exam was on Thursday evening, I spent last week studying. I typed up my in-class handwritten notes and supplemented them with material from Prof. Downing's lecture notes. In addition, I reworked our in-class HackerRank problems on my own and created my exam "cheat sheet."

## What's in your way?
Studying for midterms was my biggest obstacle last week. After Monday morning, I'll be done with exams, and I expect to get right back to work on IDB2 by Monday afternoon. Other than exams, the only thing standing between WeTheSWEople and a completed IDB2 project is coordinating times to meet and work together.

## What will you do next week?
This week my primary focus will be on IDB2. I'm hoping to make significant progress on the project before spring break derails our schedule and prevents us from meeting in person. Over the break, I hope to make some headway on my goals of revamping this site, editing past posts, and creating a how-to guide for building a SWE-focused Jekyll blog. Outside of SWE, I hope to read over the break and work on personal projects.

## What's my experience of the class?
In this week's blog Piazza post, Prof. Downing asked for feedback on the exam.

I appreciated that the exam was straightforward. Though there were a couple of questions that should have been worded differently – the question about standard deviation incorrectly asked for a solution that only iterated through the array once and an iterator question detailed expected behavior for non-negative numbers when  the tests indicated the question wanted such behavior for positive numbers – overall, I thought the test was straightforward. I wish, though, that we had been given more information prior to the exam about the number of Python and JavaScript questions it would include. Prof. Downing has spent far less time in class on JavaScript than Python, but said that he expected us to know both languages. It would have been slightly easier to study for the exam had we known that "JavaScript trivia" – like Prof. Downing's [implementation of indexabitlity for JavaScript objects](https://github.com/gpdowning/cs373/blob/master/examples/RangeT.js) – would not be tested. Nonetheless, I felt that the JavaScript material we were expected to know was fair. In addition, though I found the in-class HackerRank practices to be immensely helpful, I wish we had been given the opportunity to solve problems using map, zip, and other Python functions in class. I felt that the exercises were more focused on understanding the underlying implementation of the methods than how one might use the methods themselves. Finally, I wish that Prof. Downing would have told our class – one of the earlier SWE sessions – about class notes he added in later classes. [February 26's](https://github.com/gpdowning/cs373/blob/master/notes/02-26.py) class notes indicated that we should be familiar with how to implement standard deviation and root-mean-square error using map and reduce, but Prof. Downing did not mention the examples in the 11AM class.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is to go to sleep early. I'm making that my tip of the week mostly because I need to follow it myself. My sleep schedule got upended last week because of the exam but I want to get it back on track this week. One strategy I've found to be helpful is setting an alarm for myself to go to sleep (and following through). To often I look up at the clock and find myself surprised at how late it is. Setting a sleep alarm helps keep me honest.
