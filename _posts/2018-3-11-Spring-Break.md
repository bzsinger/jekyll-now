title: Midterms
---

Last week we continued work on IDB2 and began preparing for working individually over the break. Because most of my teammates had midterm exams last week, we were not able to find much time to work together on the project. However, we did create plans for working on our own and corresponding during spring break.

## What did you do this past week?
This week we received feedback on our IDB1 project and continued our IDB2 work. In addition to receiving comments on our report, we also got recommendations from the graders for improvements on our site and API setup. We reviewed the feedback with each of our TAs and compiled notes for changes to make to our IDB2 project. More directly related to IDB2, I worked specifically on creating a scraper for Census demographic data that we will need for our districts model.

## What's in your way?
Spring break. Our group has tended to work best when we are all in the same place, so spring break will provide a new kind of challenge. Though we've been productive when we've worked separately in the past, doing so has tended to create knowledge silos. We've thus far avoided situations where one group member is the only one who fully understands the implementation of a part of the project and next week we plan on spending some time doing code reviews and evaluating pull requests.

## What will you do next week?
This week I plan on working on the scraper for our third data source, GovTrack, and fixing my computer's Python version to allow me to run our Python code without hiccups. I initially installed Python 3 on my machine through Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook, but our IDB project uses Python 2. I've run into issues switching between the two and I'll try to work that out this week.

## What's my experience of the class?
This week was pretty low-stress. We had three attendance quizzes, a lecture on ReactJS, a guest lecture from Profs. Cline and Rich on ethics, and a lecture about function packing and unpacking. I especially enjoyed the ethics lecture. I've been taking a Comparative Religious Ethics course this semester, which has been heavily theoretical, and I enjoyed reviewing some applications of ethics theories within the realm of computer science.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to create a daily schedule and list of goals for the break. Far too often I've come back from a break feeling like I haven't accomplished much. Breaks are an easy time for routines to fall apart. Waking up at a consistent time and keeping a list of everything I want to do each day has helped me stay on track and keep myself accountable.
