Last week we finished part one of our IDB project and this week we started on part two. Most of my work this week was related to setting up a robust backend and scraper that we could use to get information from the public APIs we are using.

## What did you do this past week?
This week, we wrote out and added our stories to our Github repo project board and began working on our backed and scrapers. I focused specifically on writing a scraper that pulled from [ProPublica's Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) and stored the members in our database. Though I ran into some Python version issues, Minwoo, Palak, and I were able to create the scraper before the weekend. In addition to the new work, Michael and I went through our JavaScript frontend code with a linter and restructured our codebase. We're hoping that having a cleaner repo will make development easier (and more sustainable) in the future.

## What's in your way?
Midterms. I have a SWE exam on Thursday evening, a Security exam on Friday morning, and a Comparative Religious Ethics exam on Monday the next week. Not only am I going to be busy, my entire IDB team will be studying for their exams.

## What will you do next week?
This week I plan to go through and type up my in-class SWE notes, redo the HackerRank exercises, and practice my JavaScript and Python. I would like to meet with my group members early this week, though, to make a plan for the work we can realistically accomplish this week and to continue working on the IDB project.

## What's my experience of the class?
I'm still enjoying the class. I got called on this week to work through an exercise, and though I'm fine with being called on, it was hard to talk and take notes. I caught up quickly afterward, though.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to write down everything you have to do. Take a piece of paper and list everything you need to get done. The list might be daunting, but nothing is scarier than your imagination. I find that having everything written out helps me plan better and reduces anxiety. Even if you aren't someone who likes creating a strict schedule for yourself, try it out!
