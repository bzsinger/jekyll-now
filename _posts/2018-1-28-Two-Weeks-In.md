title: Two Weeks In
---

This blog marks the completion of my second week in CS 373: Software Engineering. I'm getting used to the class's daily quizzes and lecture format and I'm starting to feel more comfortable using the provided tools. I'm looking forward to incorporating the tools we're using in this course into my personal projects and work for other classes.

Onto the required questions!

## What did you do this past week?
This past week I (nearly) completed the assigned [Collatz](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html) project. I've been trying to pay close attention to the steps on the [workflow](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/Workflow.html), but I haven't always been able to follow them exactly. I wanted to feel like I was always making progress on the project, but that led to me skipping steps and coming back to them later. There are some parts of the workflow that should be shifted around (move steps 15-19 to after step 26), which threw me off at the beginning, but now that I know how to navigate the process better, I'll be able to go into the next project more confident.

## What's in your way?
I have several questions about project minutiae and I'm currently blocked on all fronts of the project. I plan to ask for clarification  at either Professor Downing's office hours on Monday or one of the TAs' office hours on Wednesday. My goal is to complete this project as early as possible – I'm trying to follow Steven Diaz's lead (see his [tip-of-the-week](https://medium.com/@downloadsteven/cs373-spring-2018-week-2-2193bf94b6b1)) – so moving forward on my blocked items as quickly as possible is paramount.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I plan to complete the Collatz project early and focus on catching up in my recently-added Security class. I'd also like to create a how-to guide for creating a Jekyll blog for this class. I've enjoyed having this website, and I want to make it easier for other students – in this class and in future classes – to get started quickly.

Finally, I think it would be beneficial to read more blog posts than just the one I'm required to respond to. A classmate's response to [another student's blog post](https://huangyvonneeswe.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/week-1/) (see "What's in your way?") caught my eye this week and I discovered a [wonderful quote](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/03/eat-frog/):
> If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.

My final goal for next week is to integrate that idea into my daily routine.

## What's my experience of the class?
I've had a positive experience thus far. Last week, I mentioned that I was working on staying on pace with the lecture, and during this past week Professor Downing has slowed his pace slightly, making it easier to follow along without falling behind. There are two changes I want to make next week, though.

First, I haven't yet quite figured out how to organize my notes for this class. Professor Downing prohibits students from using electronic devices for note-taking (a rule I strongly agree with), but taking pencil-and-paper notes has prevented me from rearranging my notes easily. I have Python notes interspersed with Docker tips and Collatz optimizations. This week, I will set aside time to review, type up, and rearrange my notes.

Second, I've noticed that because Professor Downing's attention is often focused, for good reason, on his laptop screen, I've found it difficult to get his attention by raising my hand. I'm hesitant to interrupt the lecture with questions, but I'll try to find lulls in the lecture, perhaps while Professor Downing is looking for a student to call on, to ask questions.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to write good READMEs. Sure, there aren't many (any?) companies looking for Senior Markdown Developers, but a good README can be the difference between a project languishing in forgotten obscurity and being popularly used. READMEs help people discover your project, and just as importantly, realize that they can use it. Joel Sposky (from last week's reading) wrote:
> Would Linux have succeeded if Linus Torvalds hadn’t evangelized it? As brilliant a hacker as he is, it was Linus’s ability to convey his ideas in written English via email and mailing lists that made Linux attract a worldwide brigade of volunteers.

People judge books by their covers. Markdown exists to help you beautify your book cover, but provide constraints to prevent you from going overboard. One of my favorite developers, [Sindre](https://sindresorhus.com/) [Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus), creator the the Github [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) format and a masterful README creator, [puts it this way](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/140):
> Open source projects are not just about code. Presentation, documentation, support, and kindness are important too.

For an example of a great README, check out his [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) project. Your READMEs don't need to be that crazy, but try add a couple of titles, gifs, and instructions. It goes a long way.
