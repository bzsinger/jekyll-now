It's been one week into our IDB project and our group seems to be moving at a steady clip. I'm working with [Michael Tirtowidjojo](https://github.com/MTirtowidjojo), [Palak Hirpara](https://github.com/palakhirpara), [William Han](https://github.com/copperstick6), [Raul Camacho](https://github.com/raulcodes), and [Minwoo Jo](https://github.com/minwoo0jo) on a [website](http://swethepeople.me/) [that](https://github.com/WeTheSWEople/SWEThePeople) will combine district Census data with information about members of the U.S. House of Representative.

## What did you do this past week?
It's been a busy week. We finalized our project topic on Wednesday, but by then we'd already set up our backend, purchased a domain name [(free for students!)](https://nc.me/), and started gathering information. We've been good so far about opening and closing issues and keeping the project board up to date. We added some basic safety checks to our repository, such as [preventing](https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-branch-restrictions/) people from accidentally (or intentionally) pushing to the master branch and [requiring reviews](https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-required-reviews-for-pull-requests/) for pull requests. After our topic was approved, we completed several pages, including [About](http://swethepeople.me/about), our main [Representatives](http://swethepeople.me/representatives) page, and our [Homepage](http://swethepeople.me).

## What's in your way?
Though we have a strong group and we've worked well over the past week, the hardest part of the collaborative aspect of the IDB projects is finding times when all group members can meet. We've partly resolved this problem by splitting our group  into three pairs for pair programming, but we've always been the most productive when we work in the same room together. In [*Extreme Programming Installed*](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Installed-Ron-Jeffries/dp/0201708426), the authors note a similar phenomenon when programmers and customers were in different parts of the same building, and thus, didn't communicate as effectively. I've come to realize that the problem exists even when programmers work far away from each other.  

Over the past week I've also become frustrated by the limit of Github's collaborative project infrastructure. I'm disappointed that Github's project board prevents us from easily splitting and sorting stories into tasks (i.e. issues) and instead focuses primarily the latter. It appears that Github sees itself as more of a host for already-completed projects than a tool for helping teams build new projects. Over this next week, I'll research other project board systems to see if I can find one that works better for teams wanting to incorporate Extreme Programming techniques.

Finally, another smaller problem I've noticed that Github has is that it does not provide repo administrators with as much control as I would like. One area where this is especially evident is pull request reviews. Though a user can request reviews from several people, pull requests may be approved with reviews from just one or two. We've found pull requests to be a good way to conduct cross-group code reviews, and allowing requesters to set some reviews as "blocking" or "mandatory" would ensure that everyone has had a chance to provide input before a change is merged in.

## What will you do next week?
This week we plan on finishing part one of the IDB project and preparing for stage two. We have some guesses about what will be required of us next week: this week we are allowed to present our data statically, next week we will need to fetch it dynamically; this week we have no need for a database, next week we will; this week we are required to design an API, next week we will need to make it functional. Our plan is to complete this first stage in such a way that pivoting to the second stage will be as seamless as possible.

## What's my experience of the class?
It may be because I have a good team, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the IDB project so far. Because of a combination of needing to keep track of commits, wanting to practice pair programming, and a positive team culture, our team has done a good job so far of keeping everyone up to date on the latest developments in the project. Having a team Slack, I should add, has also been very useful.

I'd also like to note that I very much enjoyed the Friday lecture this week. I thought it went slightly too fast – I would have moved some of the material to Wednesday – but the denouement was absolutely masterful. Professor Downing concluded the class exactly on time with an explanation that wrapped up the entire lecture's theme neatly. Besides the speed, last Friday's lecture was my favorite thus far.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This week I want to highlight two Google Chrome extensions that I've found enormously helpful over the past few months. One I've had for a while is [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en). Chrome is infamous for consuming a lot of memory and running down laptops' battery power. [This extension](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender) automatically suspends unused tabs,  improving Chrome's response time and reducing battery strain. Another similarly useful extension is [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en). OneTab provides a handy button in the Chrome bar for automatically collapsing and saving open tabs. I used to leave tabs open with articles I wanted to read or resources I wanted to look into, but having lots of tabs open drained my battery quickly. OneTab allowed me to easily keep track of websites I wanted to peruse without me having to bookmark or save each one permanently.
