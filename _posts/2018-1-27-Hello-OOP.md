title: Hello OOP
---

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was my first week of classes. This semester is my final semester at UT and I am excited to graduate. In OOP, I attended lecture and took my first quiz. I took Professor Downing's Software Engineering course exactly one year ago and I have noticed some similarities, at least at the beginning, between how he teaches the two courses. I remember reviewing Docker (albeit with a focus on setting up a Python environment rather than a C++ one) and discussing, compiling, and running, then Python and Javascript -- now C++ and Java, code. Overall, this week was tough because of other classes – I have been working to get into two courses via their waitlists (and now via their Late-Add process) – and I have had to sit in on far more classes than I am actually planning on taking this semester. I am looking forward to being able to focus on only the classes I will actually be in, rather than having to think about other courses.

## What's in your way?
The obstacles in my way are determining what my final course schedule will look like – making sure I am able to add the courses I want to join and drop the classes I do not want to continue in. I am looking forward to my schedule clearing up.

## What will you do next week?
This week I will work to complete the Late-Add process and discuss Late-Add options with several professors. In OOP, I plan to begin working on the first project once it has been assigned.

## What are your expectations of the class?
I expect this course to function, in class at least, very similarly to Professor Downing's Software Engineering course. I expect the quizzes to be challenging, the projects to be time-consuming, and the class to be taught using the Socratic Method. I expect to work hard and learn a lot.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is to use a [Jekyll blog](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for your CS371P blog! They aren't too difficult to set up and it's fun to have your own website, even if it functions (for now) as a blog for one of your classes. Feel free to check out my config.yml and style.scss files to see how I set up mine.
