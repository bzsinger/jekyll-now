title: Post-Collatz
---

This week brought another SWE milestone: I turned in my first project on Wednesday night. Collatz was a fun introduction into the course. Professor Downing readily admitted that we were required to use an excessive number of tools and techniques – TravisCI, a dev branch, mypy, pylint, pydoc – but the project provided a good opportunity to familiarize ourselves with those tools in a lower-stress environment.

## What did you do this past week?
SWE was my main focus this past week. I finalized Collatz, fixing small bugs and resolving issues, and turned in the project on Wednesday night. On Friday, Professor Downing teased our second project, the first in a series of four full-stack-database-related assignments, and I formed a team after class.

Outside of SWE, I turned in two Security projects this week: one, a Python implementation of a Caesar Cipher, and the second, a list of three methods for "tying-up" or "crashing" a computer.

Finally, today was my first day leading the CodePath iOS course. We had a good turnout and I think the students are excited about the semester. I'll also be leading the Tuesday lecture and today presented a good opportunity to iron out the class format.

## What's in your way?
Our team is required to propose a database topic, and though I have a couple of ideas, I want to find one that everyone on our team is passionate about (or at least interested in). I've found that getting "buy-in" from the whole team is the most important part of working on a project, especially a school project. Our group is planning on meeting on Monday afternoon to discuss topics and an approach to the project.

## What will you do next week?
Next week, I plan to start, and make significant headway on, the database project. Next week is going to be busy across the board: I have a project due next Sunday for Security and an essay due in my ethics class. I want to get started on SWE work as soon as possible so that we don't run into the CS373 version of an "October Surprise."

## What's my experience of the class?
I've had a positive experience of the class so far. I've noticed that Professor Downing tends to lecture faster when he presents pre-prepared code, and I've struggled to take down notes before he scrolls down. However, I've gotten better at asking for clarification. I've also shifted my strategy for preparing for the quizzes and I hope that a new approach will reduce my morning stress.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is to get more involved in an open-source community! Over the summer, as I learned more about the JavaScript open-source community, I became more interested in finding projects to contribute to and techniques to use in my personal projects. However, I struggled to find new and exciting projects. Github recently added a [Discover repositories section](https://github.com/dashboard/discover), but it wasn't dynamic enough for what I was looking for. Enter [Changelog Nightly](https://changelog.com/nightly). Every night at 10PM CT, Changelog Nightly sends out an email with a list of the most exciting new repositories on Github, and I star (read: bookmark) projects that I find interesting and want to follow-up on later. Over the past eight months, I've starred over [700 projects](https://github.com/bzsinger?tab=stars), but more importantly, I have a place to look when I'm trying to come up with a new idea for a personal project.

Another great resource is the [awesome for beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) list, a curated collection of projects that are friendly to open-source newcomers. Github hosts a lot of interesting projects that either don't have opportunities for newcomers to contribute or don't have a community support system for teaching newcomers. The awesome for beginners list is a good resource for finding places to get started.
